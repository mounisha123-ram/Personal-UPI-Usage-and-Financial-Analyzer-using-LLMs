ðŸ’¸ Personal UPI Usage and Financial Analyzer using LLMs

Overview of my Project:-
This project is an intelligent financial assistant that analyzes personal UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions from platforms like Paytm, PhonePe, GPay, etc., using Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps users gain insightful summaries, detect spending patterns, and receive smart financial advice based on their actual expenses â€” all from uploaded UPI PDF statements.
